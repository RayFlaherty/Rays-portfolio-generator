# Rays-portfolio-generator

For this project I am going to create a program using Node in order to generate a readme file by using the command-line application. I will add a video file of the use of the final project.

## Purpose
For the purpose of this project, My main goal is to be able to walk someone though some simple steps and help generate a professional style readme they can add to their own projects. 

## Installation guide.(Be sure to add why and try and add screeshots)

The first program you need to add for complete functionality is Node. You can find the link at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Be sure to navigate through all the prompts, as it is relatively self-explanatory.

Once Installed, CD into your local repository and be sure you are in your main branch. Once there type in "npm init." This will get you on your way.

Once you are through all the prompts to get through NPM, be sure to add Inquirer to your project.
